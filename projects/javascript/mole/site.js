Make a 5x4 grid of hole images.
Every second, randomly pick _a hole_ in the grid and turn it's image into a mole.
If the user clicks on a mole image, turn it back into a hole.

Use the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) function to run a callback function periodically.

## Advanced

Keep score.

* Every mole that's hit is 100 points
* Every hole that's clicked is -50 points
* If the whole screen gets filled with moles, they lose, and the game stops.
* Every 10 seconds, increase the rate at which moles appear.
