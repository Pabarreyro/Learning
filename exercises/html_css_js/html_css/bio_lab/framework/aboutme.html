            Hi! My name is Pablo. I'm from Washington, D.C., and have been living in Portland, OR, for nearly six years.
            I started my career as a marine biologist, then moved into environmental policy and economics, only to end up
            in the wacky world of web development and data analysis! In my life, I've lived in the following countries:
        </p>
        <ul style="color: darkcyan">
            <li>United States</li>
            <li>Thailand</li>
            <li>Puerto Rico</li>
            <li>Jamaica</li>
            <li>Dominican Republic</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Belize</li>
            <li>Equitorial Guinea</li>
            <li>Vietnam</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My passion is finding better ways to inform complex decision-making processes, especially on matters of public
            interest. In my spare time, I like to think about the constraints of our individual and collective thinking,
            entertaining ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Observer Effect</a>.
            I am also fascinated by the potential impact of design thinking and big data on public service.
            For leisure, I play guitar, cook, hike and climb.
